# BBQ Journal
<h2><a href="http://bbq-journal.com">bbq-journal.com</a></h2>

Note: This repo only contains frontend files for BBQ-journal.com. Here is the repo containing the (completely separate) [backend](https://github.com/benskyio/bbqjournal-backend).
 

I created BBQ-Journal.com as a place to record my BBQ recipes. Built with VueJS. The site uses JWT for API auth and provides a secure place for temperatures, ingredients, cook times and upload photos of your bbq dishes.
<br><br>
Also built with BootstrapJS, ChartJS and more "v-show" and "v-if" directives than you can shake a stick at.
