# BBQ Journal

This repo only contains frontend files for BBQ-journal.com. Here is the repo containing the (completely separate) [backend](https://github.com/benskyio/bbqjournal-backend).

Built with VueJS with more "v-show" and "v-if" directives than you can shake a stick at.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
