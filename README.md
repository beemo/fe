I created BBQ-Journal.com as a place to record my BBQ recipes. Built with VueJS. The site uses JWT for API auth and provides a secure place for tempuratures, ingredients, cook times and upload photos of your bbq dishes.
<br><br>
Also built with BootstrapJS, ChartJS and more "v-show" and "v-if" directives than you can shake a stick at.
